# ReadCam
This is a android application . This basic functionality of this application is to read text from the Images either in a running image . In is application is have used the surace view to see  the view from the camera . And In this application I have used the OCR which is meant for the Optical Character Recognisation . And for this i have use the Google Vision dependecy . Using the google vision dependency we can use the ocr class which is a predefined class in the android . The OCR  work one by one in the image , It first fetches the data from the block , then it fetches the data from the line , and at the last it just break the line into the characters . Thats all . Happy learning #AI
